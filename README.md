- From your laptop, start the play application
- Open one (or many) web browser to http://{host}:{port}/ to display the game board
- From your iPad/iPhone/Android phone (it's funnier if multiple players ;-) ),
  open a web browser and connect to your laptop, e.g http://{host}:{port}/m
- Enter your name then press Play
- Play from your iphone, each event gets sent to the server.
  Use the iphone as a command. Left tumb to move, right thumb to fire.

This application uses Akka, WebSockets, Server Sent Event and is a pure demo of Reacting programming with Play! Framework.
