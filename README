- From your laptop, start the play application
- Open one or many web browser to http://localhost:9000/ to display the game board
- From your IPad/IPhone/Android phones (funnier if multiple players ;-) ), open a web browser and connect to your laptop, e.g http://192.168.0.1:9000/m
- Enter your name then press Play
- Play from your iphone, each event gets sent to the server. Use the iphone as a command. Left tumb to move, right thumb to fire.

This application uses Akka, WebSockets, Server Sent Event and is a pure demo of Reacting programming with Play! Framework.
